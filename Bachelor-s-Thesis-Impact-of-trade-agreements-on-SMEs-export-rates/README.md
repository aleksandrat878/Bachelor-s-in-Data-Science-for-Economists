# The Impact of AANZFTA on SME Export Participation in Southeast Asia

This repository contains the full dataset, R code, and analyses for my undergraduate thesis at Utrech University, titled “The Impact of ASEAN+1 Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) on SME Export Rates in Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam.”

The thesis employs a quantitative approach to investigate how AANZFTA influences SME export participation, incorporating theories of internationalization and institutional quality.
Key analyses include:

* Fixed-effects panel regressions with interaction terms, lagged variables, and log-transformed dependent variables

* Non-linear probit models to capture threshold effects and complex dynamics

* Event study specifications to examine temporal effects of AANZFTA

Comprehensive robustness checks addressing heteroskedasticity, serial correlation, multicollinearity, and sensitivity to alternative SME export estimations

The repository includes all code, datasets, and visualizations, providing a transparent and reproducible framework for analyzing the impact of trade policies on SMEs in emerging markets.
