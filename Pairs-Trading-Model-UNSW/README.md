# Pairs Trading Model – Pepsi & Cola
This repository contains a Pairs Trading Model developed during the Trade and Market Making course at UNSW Sydney Business School.

The model focuses on the Pepsi and Coca-Cola stock pair and serves as a foundation for automated trading strategies. Using live market data, it generates signals to enter or exit positions based on the relative prices of the two stocks. The objective is to maximize returns by strategically buying and selling the stocks in a market-neutral manner.
