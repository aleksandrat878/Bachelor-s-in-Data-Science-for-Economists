# Sustainable-Finance-Project-ESG-Solar-Energy-in-Emerging-Markets

This repository presents a research project analyzing how Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices influence the financial performance of solar energy companies in emerging markets such as India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia.

The project uses a quantitative approach (linear, multiple, and Bayesian regression) with real-world GDP and renewable energy data to simulate potential outcomes, exploring whether ESG adoption enhances firm performance (ROA, ROE, stock returns). The findings aim to guide investors, firms, and policymakers in designing ESG strategies tailored to the unique challenges of emerging markets.
