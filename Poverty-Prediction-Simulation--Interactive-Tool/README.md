# Can We Predict Poverty? – Data Science Lab Project
This repository contains a Data Science Lab project conducted at Utrecht University, focusing on poverty risk prediction using socioeconomic, demographic, and digital inclusion indicators.

We analyzed data from 12,600 individuals across seven anonymized countries and applied a range of models, including linear regression and XGBoost, to uncover the main drivers of poverty vulnerability. Our findings highlight the importance of digital literacy, education, and rural residence in shaping poverty outcomes.

The project also features an interactive Shiny app that enables policymakers to simulate poverty risk, identify vulnerable groups, and explore targeted interventions. The results provide data-driven insights for smarter poverty alleviation strategies and personalized policy design

The "Can we Predict Poverty?" file contains the full report based on the "rmd.Rmd" R code. To open Shiny app download "server.R" and "ui.R' together with datasets included.
